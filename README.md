# Telecommunication Data Analysis
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a telecommunications dataset to derive insights on user behavior, device usage, and network performance. The main objective is to help TellCo decide whether to focus on acquiring new users or improving existing services. We will achieve this by identifying patterns in data consumption, device popularity, and user engagement metrics.

## Setup Environment
The first step is to set up a Python development environment with version control and implement CI/CD workflows for continuous integration and deployment.

## Deliverables
- Python environment setup.
- GitHub repository with branches and version control.
- CI/CD workflows configured in .github/workflows/.

## User Overview Analysis

## Objective
 The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior by analyzing their device preferences, network usage patterns, and app engagement.

## Tasks
- Create a GitHub repository and set up branch task-1.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to identify key insights regarding customer behavior.
- Commit work at least three times a day with clear messages.

## User Engagement Analysis:
## Objective 
- Calculate engagement metrics such as session frequency, session duration, and network traffic.
- Segment users based on their behavior and device usage patterns using k-means clustering.

## Development
- Create a new branch task-2 for this phase of development.
- Commit progress with clear messages.
- Use pull requests (PR) to merge updates into the main branch.

## Dependencies
To ensure the project runs smoothly, the following libraries are required:
- pandas
- streamlit
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new feature branch (feature-your-feature).
- Commit your changes and push to your branch.
- Open a pull request and describe the changes in detail.
